This is a fork from mit-xv6 for operating system course project
You can find main repo in https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public

** How to Run
As you know there are several ways to compile and run an O.S. but I strongly recommend using docker. you can find some docs at https://docs.docker.com

1-Clone into this repo ($ git clone https://github.com/Farbodxrs/xv6-public.git)  
2-Pull image from docker hub ($ docker pull grantbot/xv6:latest) // you can use other images as well or make yours, but this one works fine.
3-Run your container ($ docker run -v '/{Path to local xv6 folder}':/home/a/xv6/ -it --name xv6 --rm grantbot/xv6 bash )
4-Now you are in the container, you should go into project ($ cd /home/a/xv6)
Its time to compile and run xv6 O.S., qemu seems fine but feel free to try new ones. docs at https://www.qemu.org/documentation/
5-As I dont have VGA console in container, I use($make) and then  ($make qemu-nox). (There is 'make qemu-nox-gdb' option which lets you to open a GDB port! whats gdb? =>https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Server.html) 


*How to exit qemu :))
press ctrl+a => c
now you are in qemu console, press q then enter to exit.
press ctrl + D to exit container, because of --rm in running it, container will be destroyed as you leave.
